Type of Version: Major Change 

Fix a problem in version 003 where due to the computation of the implicit-event transition matrix 
by computing separately the transition matrices of the actions and events: it is the case that the update of 
requirements with deadline is not correct. For example, when two events occur concurrently with an action, the 
remaining time for the satisfaction of a deadline requirement is reduced by the number of concurrent events
which is not desired

To fix the problem: we compute transitions by
1) identifying events that are applicable in a state
2) identifying actions that are applicable in a state 
3) computing change in state for possible concurrent executions of actions and events
4) update the states of requirements in state
5) repeat from 3 until all possible concurrent executions are explored

This is a major change as it impacts the computation of the transition matrix and possibly the reward matrix
