ToDo: Implementation

1) Verify whether the semantics of concurrency is that of control actions are taken first then exogenous events in any order?
It seems that it is not the case: 
in description alica_v2f: 
the robot tries to fetch the order while it is in preparation and there is a transition to a state where order=fetched

Action fetch_order1
if location=kitchen & order1=ready
	 effects <order1=fetched>;
	 
Event order_ready1
if order1=in_preparation 
	occurrence probability 0.3 
	effects <order1=ready>;
