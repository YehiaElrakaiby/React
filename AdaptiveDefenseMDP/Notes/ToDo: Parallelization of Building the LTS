When identifying transitions, parallelization can be used:
parallelization can be used not only to explore multiple states in parallel but also to compute the result of execution of actions and events from a state
Input: a set of states S that includes initial states only, all marked unexplored
1) select states s that are marked unexplored from S and mark them explored,
2) explore in parallel those states,
3) compute in parallel the result of executing different actions and events from a state to identify other reachable states, 
3.1) add reachable states to S
4) when exploration of states s ends, go to 1)
